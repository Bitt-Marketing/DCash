                    <h3>How to receive a payment</h3>
                    <p>To receive a payment, display your invoice QR code to the consumer–they can simply scan it with their mobile device, using the DCash Wallet application. The QR code can also be sent as a link via text message or another application. In this case, the consumer can pay the invoice by clicking or tapping on the link, or they can manually enter it into their Wallet application. Either way, digital currency is transferred directly from the consumer to the merchant.</p>
                    <p>There are three ways in which a merchant can accept payment from consumers using the DCash Wallet and DCash Merchant applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><b>Invoice QR Code</b> – When you create an invoice, an invoice QR code is generated. A consumer can simply scan the code with their mobile device.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Paste the Payment Code</b> – You can send the consumer the invoice code (via text message or another app). They can tap the link, or copy and paste it into the app.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Enter the Invoice Payment Code Manually</b> – To type the payment code, a consumer taps Enter Code Manually.</p></li>
                        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The consumer will have the option to edit the amount before authorizing the payment.</p>
                    </ul>

                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Tap Invoice at the bottom of the screen.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Enter the amount and then tap Confirm Amount.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Add an Optional Note.</p></li>
                        <li><p>An invoice QR code is displayed on your device. The consumer can either scan this using DCash Wallet on their device, or you can tap Invoice Code to send a payment link directly to them.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <!--
                    <h4>Consumer</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>After the merchant creates and sends the invoice, use your DCashWallet to either scan the invoice QR code, tap the invoice link, or manually enter the code.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tap Continue.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Enter the amount of the payment, and tap Continue again.</p></li>
                        <li><p>On the Review Payment Request screen, make sure that the recipient and amount of the payment are correct and add an Optional Note.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Slide to Send the money.</p></li>
                        <li><p>After the payment is sent, the merchant receives a notification and can view the payment history.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    -->

                    <h4>Use a single invoice code for multiple transactions</h4>
                    <p>If a merchant wishes to receive payments without having to present their device to the consumer each time, they can simply print and display their invoice QR code in their place of business. The merchant should check their own device to ensure that the transaction was processed completely each time. For proper record-keeping, be sure to use the admin account to generate the code. Otherwise, the transactions will be attributed to the person with whose account the code was created.</p>
