                    <h3>How to sign up and register for a digital wallet account</h3>
                    <p>The DCash Wallet gives you a choice on how to sign up and register for an account–either through your bank or by using your government-issued ID. In both cases, you’ll need to have some information or documents available before you begin:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p><b>Register with a code from your bank</b> – The code and your bank account number. The code can be requested in person from your financial institution and is sent to you via email. This is the preferred method.</p></li>
                        <li id="code"><p><b>Register without a code</b> – Your government-issued photo ID and a valid email address. This method cannot guarantee you one of the limited spots in the pilot.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>How to register with a code</h4>
                    <p>To register with a code from your bank, you will need the code and your bank account number.</p>

                    <ol >
                        <li><p>On the home screen, tap Sign Up.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tap Sign up With Code.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Enter the code–you can either scan the QR code that you received from your financial institution, copy and paste the code, or enter it manually.</p></li>
                        <li><p>On the Code Registered confirmation screen, confirm the information and tap Continue.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Note: If the information on this screen is incorrect, contact your financial institution. On the Create Account screen, enter your Email address and Phone Number.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Next, create and confirm a password for your account. Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and can be any combination of letters, numbers or characters. We recommend a strong password that cannot be easily guessed. When you’re done, tap Continue.</p></li>
                        <li><p>On the Personal Information screen, enter your Bank Account Number, the name on the account, and your Date of Birth. Tap Continue.</p></li>
                        <li><p>On the next screen, confirm the registration information and agree to the Terms of Service.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tap Submit Application. It generally takes 1-2 business days to verify your information and activate your account. You’ll receive an email at the address provided when the process is complete.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="note" id="nocode"><b>Note:</b> After you submit your application, you will be given a 24-word recovery phrase that allows you to recover access when you switch devices. It is important to write these words down and keep them in a safe place.</p>

                    <h4>How to register without a code</h4>
                    <p>To register without a code from your bank, you will need a government-issued photo ID and a valid email address.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>On the home screen, tap Sign Up.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Next, you will need to provide a photo of your government-issued identification and then take a picture of yourself for comparison. Select the Country of Issue and Type of ID. Only one type is required.</li>
                        <li><p>Follow the on-screen directions to add your identification.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Follow the directions to take your picture for verification of the uploaded ID.</p></li>
                        <li><p>On the review screen, make sure that all your information is correct and agree to the Terms of Service.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tap Submit Application. It generally takes 1-2 business days to verify your information and activate your account. You will be added to the pilot as open seats are available. You’ll receive an email at the address provided when the process is complete.</p></li>
